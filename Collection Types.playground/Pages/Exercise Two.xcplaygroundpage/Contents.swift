import Foundation


/*:
 2. Now populate the array with twenty random ratings between 1 and 100.
 */


/*:
 3. Determine the average rating. Remember, calculate an average by finding the sum of all the values, then dividing by the number of values.
 */


/*:
 4. The restaurant is most concerned with how many diners considered their meal to be less than satisfactory. Calculate the percentage of diners who gave the restaurant a rating less than 80.
 */

/*:
 5. The manager wants more detail. Prepare a report that indicates how many diners found the restuarant "Very Bad" (0 to 25), "Bad" (25 to 49), "Fair" (50 to 79), "Satisfactory" (80 to 89), and "Stellar" (90 to 100).
